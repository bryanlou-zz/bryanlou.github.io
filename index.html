					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Welcome to my work term report created for Freshbooks! Here you'll learn about my duties at Freshbooks as a Software Developer as well as learn more about the product and the work I completed this term.
					</p>
					<h2>Freshbooks</h2>
					<p>
						Freshbooks is a software as a service company which helps empower small business owners who don't know accounting, manage their expenses, request invoices and much more. First and foremost, the culture and talent at Freshbooks
						is among the best, I had a great time working there and I truly felt like a full-time employee. The office itself was also amazing, a dog friendly office never failed to put a smile on my face and I think I gained an equal amount of skill at pingpong
						as I did coding!
					</p>
					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>
						At the job, I had many goals which included: <br>
						- Gain knowledge of a flask and python back-end development <br>
						- Learn a front-end javascript framework, Ember in this case <br>
						- Develop my skills in machine learning and data science <br>

						These were goals as I entered the job, and many I was able to fulfill, as well as many new ones I created a long the way.
					</p>
					<h2>Job Description</h2>
					<p>
						At Freshbooks, I worked on team Compass and eventually team Encompass , which has a mandate to help guide users through all stages of the web app and then work on customer acquisition. Lots of my work was focused in either Flask (Python) and EmberJS (Javascript) work. I worked 
						on features using customer data on how to better the product, which included tasks such as: increasing mobile app engagement, SMS integration and iOS push notifications. My everyday consisted of getting into office, attending meetings and standup then getting to code. For every task I did, 
						tests were a large portion of the development, so I was able to learn about various testing suites such as Capybara and the Cucumber tool. As well, I received valuable feedback on all my pull requests from experienced software developers at the company which helped
						accelerate my learning and progression as a softwarew developer.
					</p>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>
						In conclusion I had a great time working at Freshbooks and the employees and my team especially made it a great experience. The company truly valued each employee and motivated development and learning, and was a great four months towards my career
						growth.

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						Welcome to my work term report created for Tulip Retail! Here you'll learn about my duties at Tulip as a full stack developer as well as learn more about the product and the market space it occcupies.
					</p>
					<h2>Tulip Retail</h2>
					<p>
						Tulip is a software service company which aims at empowering the sales associate in a retail setting. Think of it as bridging the gap between ecommerce and brick and mortar stores.
						The app is designed for iOS mobile tablets, and displays a store catalogue with options to purchase alongside many other features. The culture at Tulip is great, with an emphasis on
						inclusion and was a great working environment as a co-op student. There are two offices, one in Kitchener and one in Toronto, I worked at the Kitchener location.
					</p>
					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>
						At the job, I had many goals which included: <br>
						- Gain knowledge of a ticketing system and it's workflow <br>
						- Write cleaner code with emphasis on reliability and readability <br>
						- Learn new technologies, frameworks and languages <br>

						These were goals as I entered the job, and they all remained, but new ones emerged as I took upon more responsibilities and learned more about the job.
					</p>
					<h2>Job Description</h2>
					<p>
						My main duties were back-end development, with focus on PHP with a little bit of Python. I focused on integrations work, which is the transformation of a clients data into our own system's data to be used on the app.
						Skills needed for the job include attentiveness to detail and efficiency. Also working with a team, collaboration is a huge skill which is always required in almost any environment. A unique and interesting aspect of my job
						was working with large amounts of data and creating importers with a focus on algorithm efficency. Some transferrable skills included PHP and Python which I happened to learn in a few courses, although the rest I learned on the job.
					</p>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>
						In conclusion I had a great time working at Tulip and the employees there made the experience a blast. I learned a lot of skills which are definitely transferrable to other jobs and my future career in
						computer science. Being able to work at such a forward thinking company is truly inspiring that is creating a disruptive product in today's markets.
